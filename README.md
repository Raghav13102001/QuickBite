# QuickBite - Food Ordering Platform

Welcome to QuickBite, a food ordering platform where users can browse, select items, add them to their cart, and place orders securely. This project aims to provide a seamless experience for users to order food items conveniently.

## Objective

The objective of QuickBite is to design and implement a food ordering platform with the following features:

1. *User Registration and Authentication*: Allow users to register with their email and password securely, and implement authentication mechanisms for secure logins.
   
2. *Browse Item Inventory*: Enable users to browse items by category and display available inventory creatively.
   
3. *Selection Basket/Cart*: Allow users to add items to their basket/cart, handle stock availability checks, save cart history across devices, and manage multiple logins.
   
4. *Checkout*: Provide a transparent breakdown of the total before checkout, notify users about successful transactions, handle item availability, and maintain order history.
   
5. *Security*: Implement necessary security measures to protect user data and prevent common security vulnerabilities.
   
6. *Important Considerations*: Design proper database tables, create backend services and APIs, develop a user-friendly GUI, and pay attention to detail.
   
7. *Documentation*: Provide detailed documentation on setting up and running the application.
